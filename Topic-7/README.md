# Topic 7: JavaScript Functions

## Assignment 1

Write a JavaScript function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By
definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent
number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34
Sensitivity: Internal & Restricted

## Assignment 2

Write a JavaScript function that combines two lists by alternately taking elements. For example:
given the two lists [a, b, c] and [1, 2, 3], the function should return [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3].

## Assignment 3

Write a JavaScript function to get the last 'n' elements of the array. If array has 6 elements and if
user gives 4, it has to return last 4 elements. If user gives ‘n’ which is greater than the number of
elements in the array, then it should return all elements.

## Assignment 4

Write a JavaScript function to parse an URL and print the details like protocol, port, host, query
parameters and route parameters if any
